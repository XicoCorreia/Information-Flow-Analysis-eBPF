Thesis
- Test analysis directly with eBPF programs
- Option 1
  - Create ebpf program in C
  - Use clang to translate it to assembly
  - If needed preprocess the assembly (use ebpf-tools?)
  - Run my analysis
- Option 2
  - Use clang to generate .o fike (ELF and bytecode)
  - Disassemble .o, retrieve bytecode
  - Translate it to haskell-compatible format (use ebpf-tools?)
  - Run analysis
  - Run the kernel verifier
- Kenny's ebpf-tools used to assemble and disassemble bytecode/asm, not yet completed
  could be interesting completing it, also quasiquote still not fully developed
