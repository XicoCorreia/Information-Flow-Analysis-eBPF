Questions:
1. How to translate Jset to an Equation
signed equal
2. In assignReg what happen if r index is a high security and content is low
Yes
3. Should I only allow a certain number of registers and what if the program uses a not defined register?
Only 11 registers and 512 mem cells
4. How would I incorporate interval analysis, run both analysis at the same time?
Run first -> Then use the information for the information flow analysis

Dominance Frontier:
Dominator -> If I want to go from start to n, I always pass a, a dominates n
Post-Dominator -> If I want to go from n to end, I always pass b, b post dominates n
Dominance frontier -> 
- DF of node d is the set of all nodes ni such that d dominates an immediate predecessor
  of ni, but d does not strictly dominate ni, it is the set of nodes where d's dominance stops
- So the dominance frontier are all the nodes executed that depend on d
- If a node in your control flow graph has less than 2 predecessors, then it won't be in the dominance frontier 
  of any node - as it cannot be a merge point for competing definitions.
- It is where the dominance of some nodes end

Domiance frontiers work as limits for the nodes that rely on the secret, if inside the body it relies, otherwise it is not

Work more around post dominance, so if it is poost frontier + post dominance do not care
