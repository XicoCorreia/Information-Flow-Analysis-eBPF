Status update
- Everything should be working

Questions
- Question about sum_even10.asm graph
- Would node 3 depend on five
- Go through the two different paths, when reachs Post dominant or itself the body has stopped
  - Itself is  obvious, we just looped
  - PD it is a common node, always ran when going through that branch or only if it is in PD AND DF,
  meaning the only way to reach there isnt through the secret node
- More related to non inference, should I even care about this or is it unrelated problem:
  - If I have a mov from a low, should I reset the security level depending on the initial?
    Example: while (h) do { l := l+1 }; l := 0

Thesis
- Developing a eBPF-based taint analysis framework: This could involve tracking sensitive data (like secrets or credentials) 
  through syscalls, memory writes, and network activity
- Kenny's ebpf-tools used to assemble and disassemble bytecode/asm, not yet completed
  could be interesting completing it, also quasiquote still not fully developed
- Operational Semantics
- Context-sensitive flow rules
- Preserving Security Properties (Confidentiality and Integrity)
- Ensure that your analysis is both sound (it doesn't miss violations) and complete (it detects all violations)
- Fixpoint Convergence
- Real world utility
- How to run Test analysis directly with eBPF programs
  - Option 1
    - Create ebpf program in C
    - Use clang to translate it to assembly
    - If needed preprocess the assembly (use ebpf-tools?)
    - Run my analysis
  - Option 2
    - Use clang to generate .o fike (ELF and bytecode)
    - Disassemble .o, retrieve bytecode
    - Translate it to haskell-compatible format (use ebpf-tools?)
    - Run analysis
    - Run the kernel verifier
