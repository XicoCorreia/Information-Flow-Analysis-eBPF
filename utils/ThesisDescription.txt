This thesis proposes the formalization of a framework for information flow analysis in extended Berkeley 
Packet Filter (eBPF) programs. The goal is to track the propagation of sensitive data through an eBPF 
program, by using security levels, Low or High, to classify the information. This will provide insights 
into potential leaks of secret information. By integrating taint analysis tracking capabilities into eBPF 
programs, this framework enhances security and reliability for the programs, while addressing a critical 
challenge eBPF programs face, ensuring secure data flows, particularly in preventing unintended information 
leakage or privilege escalation.

This framework will be modelled and formalized using operational semantics and context-sensitive flow rules, 
using mathematical constructs to prove soundness, ensuring no violations are missed, and also completeness, 
detecting all violations. Fixpoint convergence techniques will be employed, ensuring that it completes when 
the analysis reaches a stable state, this is particularly important when working with more complex scenarios.

The analysis of an eBPF program follows a straightforward workflow. The original program is converted into 
bytecode, which is then disassembled into an assembly program and finally this program is analysed by the 
framework. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, real-world scenarios and known problematic programs 
will be tested, including tracking credential leaks in network traffic and analyzing system calls for 
unauthorized memory access.

This research addresses a critical gap in eBPF studies, offering both theoretical contributions to information 
flow security and practical tools for enhancing eBPF's safety in production environments.
